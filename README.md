# **Netflix-BIU Platform**

This project delivers a full-stack Netflix-style streaming platform, combining a React-based Web Application, an Android Application developed with Java/XML, and a Node.js + MongoDB backend. It supports dynamic movie browsing, user authentication, admin capabilities, and multi-platform access.

The system operates with the following features:

### Key Features
1. **Multi-Platform Architecture:** A fully functional React web app and Android native app communicate with a central server.
2. **MongoDB Database**: Efficient, scalable storage for movies, users, and categories.
3. **User Experience**: Users can register, log in, browse movies, view details, and stream content.
4. **Admin Management**:  Admins can dynamically manage categories and movies.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT-based secure authentication with role-based access control.
6. **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme toggle supported across platforms.
7. **MVVM Android Structure**: Android app follows the MVVM architecture with Room DB and LiveData.
